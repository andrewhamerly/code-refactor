# Code Refactor - Module #1 Challenge

## Description

A project to learn best practices for code refacting with HTML and CSS. This project was built to reenforce learning the concept of HTML and CSS with proper semantic elements, commenting, and organization. This helps to bridge my previous knowledge with modern best practices when working with a project that is lacking semantic elements or duplicated efforts with code. I learned that less is more and order is important.
